BASIC

1. Create a list of ids whose corresponding first_name starts with either 'A' or 'S'
2. Create a dictionary containing the key = 'id' and value = 'first_name' of all the Females.
3. Create a tuple containing all the ids having numbers [7,8,9] in ip_address
4. Create a set out of all the keys of dictionary created in step 2
5. Create a function that takes in parameter from step 4, returns a list containing ip_address of corresponding ids.

HARD

1. Write a sorting function that takes input as result from basic task 5, sorts the result based on element%10 in descending order. (ignore all other characters except numbers)
    eg-> you have ip address as 10.192.168.92, "." was ignored so the element is 1019216892, elem%10 = 2.
    Also take care of worst case time complexity of your solution.
2. Write all above results in a file.
